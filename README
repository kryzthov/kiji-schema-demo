This project contains a small demo of KijiSchema/KijiMR.
In particular, this demonstrates the following:
 - how to use KijiSchema to read/write cells,
 - how to use KijiMR to write a bulk-importer/producer/gatherer/reducer.
 - how to use the Kiji testing framework to unit-test all of these.

To compile and run the tests:
  mvn clean test
